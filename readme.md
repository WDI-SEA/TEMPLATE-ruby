#TEMPLATE Ruby

A template for Ruby projects, with a `src` folder and `Gemfile` for Ruby linting.

##Getting Started

This is a template, so these instructions assume you'll be setting up a new repo. In order to pull new updates to this template, we recommend that you **add this repo as a remote.**

* Create a new repository
  * `git init` in a new folder, or create a repo on Github and clone to your computer
* Navigate to the new repository and add this repository as a remote.
  * `git remote add template git@github.com:WDI-SEA/TEMPLATE-ruby.git`
* Pull the template into your new repository
  * `git pull template master`
  * You should now have the template files in your repo
* Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
